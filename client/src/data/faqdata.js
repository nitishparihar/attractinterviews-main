        question: "What is ATS?",
        answer: `ATS stands for Applicant Tracking System, which is a software tool used by companies to 
                filter out resumes that are not worth being looked at. Nowadays almost every job application 
                website has an in-built ATS where an employer can set a match rate based on keywords. 
                Finally, ATS filters out the resume and only a handful of them reach human (HR).`,

                statements. We don't believe in rushing out our clients and are committed to client satisfaction. 
                Therefore, we write resumes/cover letters/LinkedIn according to ATS compliant current industry 
                standards which not only look professional but are liked by HR and recruiters. Moreover,
